"""
(Improving) Incremental Stochastic Beam Search (SBS) implementation for NumPy, mainly based on the implementation in UniqueRandomizer
https://github.com/google-research/unique-randomizer/blob/master/unique_randomizer/unique_randomizer.py
with alterations, such as:
    - Our log prob modification, see below.
    - batching SBS to allow higher batch sizes in the policy network
    - flag for keeping memory low (i.e., deleting client states after they have been visited but keeping the logits)

The key idea is to modify the log-probabilities of nodes in sampled trajectories. We do this in two ways:
1.) Subtract the log-prob of a sampled sequence from all intermediate nodes in the sequence. This is incremental
    SBS, where we perform sampling without replacement over many batches.
2.) Use the sampled trajectories to compute the expected objective over the policy (derived from priority sampling),
    then update the log-probs of all intermediate nodes with the advantage of the trajectory over the expectation.
    Note: we need to be careful about proper normalization.

        Compute the expected outcome of rolling out the current policy given the sampled trajectories from SBS.
        For details of how to compute it, we refer to the original SBS paper
        "https://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/kool19a/kool19a.pdf", Section 4.2 "BlEU score estimation".

        Parameters:
            sbs_leaves [List[sbs.BeamLeaf]]: Sampled trajectories from which we compute the expected value.
            simple_mean [bool]: If True, we do not compute the expected outcome using the Gumbels, but merely perform
                a simple average over the leaf outcomes.
            normalize_importance_weights [bool]: In practice, the importance weighted estimator can have high variance,
                and it can be preferable to normalize them by their sum. Default is `True`.
            min_max_normalize_advantage [bool]: If True, we perform a min max normalization on the advantages so that
                the highest/lowest advantage is 1/-1.
            use_pure_outcomes [bool]: If True, we do not subtract the expected value from the actual outcomes, but
                simply return the outcome uncentered. This can be desirable in, e.g., a board game situation, where
                we want to value wins/losses regardless of the expected value of the trajectories.

        Returns:
            expected_outcome [float]: Expectation computed from sbs_leaves using importance weights.
            outcomes [np.array]: Full array of outcomes of leaves.
            normalized_advantages [np.array]: Advantages normalized such that the maximum positive in the beam
                has advantage 1, the expected value has advantage 0 and the minimum negative has advantage -1.
